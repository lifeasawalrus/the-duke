# The Duke

This is a learning project to familiarize myself with the Defold game engine as well as with the many complications and considerations inherent in networking.

This is an online version of a boardgame I have laying around--The Duke, by Catalyst Game Labs. I do not own the rights to anything pertaining to the game itself. The assets are free and publicly available via [URL](put that url here, I don't remember it).
